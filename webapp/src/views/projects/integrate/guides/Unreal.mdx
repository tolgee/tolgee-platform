To read full documentation about the Tolgee Unreal plugin, visit [docs](https://tolgee.io/platform/integrations/unreal_plugin/usage).

## Installing the plugin

First, you need to install the plugin from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/2757e202f8f3408bbf66f65d26223398) and add it to your project/engine.

Alternatively, you can clone the plugin from [GitHub](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-unreal) and compile it locally.

## Enabling the plugin

To enable the Tolgee plugin inside Unreal, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Toolbar `Edit` menu
2. Open the `Plugins` window
3. Find the Tolgee plugin and tick the checkbox next to it
4. Press `Restart now` or restart your project manually.

## Localization Provider setup

Open the Unreal Engine Localization Dashboard (located at Tools â†’ Localization Dashboard) and have the `Localization Service Provider` tab open.

Set the `Localization Service Provider` to `Tolgee` via the dropdown.

This will spawn 2 additional fields, set their values to:

1. `Api Url`:

```sh
{{{apiUrl}}}
```

2. `Api Key`:

```sh
{{{apiKey}}}
```

## Localization Target setup

For each Localization Target of your game you want to connect to Tolgee, go under the `Languages` section and you should have 3 additional buttons on the actions toolbar.

1. `Tolgee Pull`
2. `Tolgee Push`
3. `Tolgee Settings`

Press `Tolgee Settings` and set the `Project Id` to:

```sh
{{{projectId}}}
```

## Workflow explained:

To make the initial push (or to update it after creating/deleting/updating keys):

1. Run Unreal's `Gather Text` followed by `Tolgee Push`
2. Go inside the Tolgee web dashboard and translate
3. Run `Tolgee Pull` to get the latest data from your dashboard
