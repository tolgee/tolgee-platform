It saves you valuable time that would otherwise be spent on localization tasks while ensuring your software is flawlessly translated.

### In context translating & One click screenshots

Easily add translations to your code and edit them directly within your app using the Tolgee i18n tool. Simply hold the ALT/Option key and click on an element to open a dialog where you can modify your strings effortlessly—no need to navigate through bulky .json/.po/.whatever files. Plus, in-context translation works seamlessly even in the production environment.

Just one click—that’s all it takes to capture a screenshot of your application with highlighted phrases for translation. Simply hold ALT + click on a string, then hit the camera button. Boom! Your screenshot is instantly generated.

### Translating on production

In-context translation works seamlessly even in the production environment of your deployed app. With the Tolgee Tools Chrome plugin, simply enter your API key and start translating—no coding skills required. This makes it easy for anyone to contribute to your app’s translations effortlessly.

### True integrations

Tolgee isn't just another localization platform that simply syncs your local data with a backend. Instead, it seamlessly integrates into your app through powerful SDKs, providing a truly embedded translation experience.

### Machine translation

We support **DeepL, Google Translate, and AWS Translate**—simply choose your preferred services in the settings. With machine translation, the localization process becomes significantly faster, allowing translators to leverage AI-powered suggestions for more efficient and accurate translations.

### Translation memory

Tolgee automatically suggests translations based on those you've previously used in the project, ensuring consistency across similar phrases.  

Translation memory suggestions include the **similarity percentage, the key, and the original text** of the translated string, making it easy to maintain accuracy and coherence.

### Auto translation

When enabled, Tolgee instantly translates new keys using **translation memory** or **machine translation services**, ensuring your strings are translated immediately upon creation. Simply choose whether to use translation memory and select your preferred machine translation service for seamless automation.

### Activity log

Easily track who modified, reviewed, or commented on phrases in your project—all with complete clarity.

### Comment on translations

If something seems off, let others know what you'd change. You can leave comments on any translation directly within the Tolgee platform.

### Translation history

Easily track changes to specific translations of a particular key in a specific language. If something's amiss, you'll know exactly where to point the finger!
