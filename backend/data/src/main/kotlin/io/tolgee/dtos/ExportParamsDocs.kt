e.g. For key "home.header.title" would result in {"home": {"header": "title": {"Hello"}}} structure.

When null, resulting file won't be structured. Works only for generic structured formats (e.g. JSON, YAML),

The template is a string that can contain the following placeholders: {namespace}, {languageTag}, 
{androidLanguageTag}, {snakeLanguageTag}, {extension}. 

For example, when exporting to JSON with the template `{namespace}/{languageTag}.{extension}`, 
the English translations of the `home` namespace will be stored in `home/en.json`.

The `{snakeLanguageTag}` placeholder is the same as `{languageTag}` but in snake case. (e.g., en_US).

The Android specific `{androidLanguageTag}` placeholder is the same as `{languageTag}` 
but in Android format. (e.g., en-rUS)
